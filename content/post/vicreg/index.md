Head on to [Medium for this post](https://medium.com/@julien.marteen.akay/vicreg-for-non-contrastive-self-supervised-learning-3fc7b0460688) as this page is currently under maintenance and does not contain all my content at one place right now.

**It will answer the following questions:**  
- Why self-supervised learning (SSL)?
- Why non-contrastive SSL?
- What’s up with VICReg?
- Then I’ll give you some additional info/low hanging fruit.
