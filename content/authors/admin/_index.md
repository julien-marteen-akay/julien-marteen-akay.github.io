Hi! I'm Julien Marteen Akay, an ML research engineer in industry and deep learning research associate in academia. View my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rk4o8Lkwv0f1d9SKO-J6Oi3S-34N0uIc/view?usp=drive_link).

My research interests revolve around the goal of developing **human-level AI**. I focus on objective-driven AI (ODAI) and self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly in the context of autonomous AI systems. Additionally, I plan to pursue a PhD in advanced (autonomous) machine intelligence while continuing to work full-time in the industry.

Inspired by [A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf), I've enjoyed presenting talks on topics like Latent-Variable Energy-Based Models, which enable neural networks to handle one-to-many mappings, and scalable SSL approaches such as [VICReg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04906). I’ve applied these techniques to areas like healthcare AI and microscopy image denoising, and I’m excited to explore better approaches to achieving truly autonomous AI.
